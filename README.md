# Project-ideas
Things I want to do, eventually. When I find the time and motivation. These are my OC:s pls don't steal

## 2 hour Suika challenge
Make a clone of suika game / watermelon game in 2 hours or less.

## 2d global illumination renderer
could be cool for a Terraria-like. or any 2d game, really. 

## Terminal tracker
making a music creation tool could be fun. start from the [toy-synthesizer](https://github.com/II-Day-II/toy-synthesizer)

## Compute-shader rendering framework
Basically shadertoy but compute shaders with WGSL? 
STARTED: [tinfoil](https://github.com/II-Day-II/tinfoil)

## Voronoi sphere
Make a 3d voronoi diagram out of moving points in a sphere. Raymarch through it to collect colors? Finish tinfoil first?
